### Hi there, I'm Ramsha. ðŸ‘‹ 
Welcome to my github! Here you can find public repositories of my PhD and postdoctoral projects. Don't hesitate to contact me if you'd like to chat about them!


### :woman_technologist: About Me :

- I currently work for a tech startup where we implement Reinforcement Learning algorithms for a range of applications, from simulation of pedestrian dynamics for self-driving cars, to solving combinatorial optimization problems in smart factories.
- ðŸ”­ I did a postdoc at the department of Meteorology at Stockholm University. I was funded by the Swedish e-Sciences Research Centre (SeRC).
- ðŸŒ± I developed  a statistical emulator for the atmospheric model [SCAM6](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2018MS001578). I used the emulator to generate enough data to conduct global sensitivity analysis (GSA), and identify influential parameters on radiative forcing (modern - preindustrial), such as aerosol emissions or thermodynamic variables. 
- :ocean: My PhD research focused on optimising prediction of tsunami waves, by optimally integrating observed data of the sea surface into a mathematical model. I also used mathematical analysis to derive sensitivity of the prediction to model parameters.
- I'm motivated by the idea of optimally merging mathematical models with the boatload of data we have these days, to innovate models for processes having huge social impact.
<!--
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about tsunami waves, clouds, and modelling the ocean floor! Also, how not to forget how memory allocation works in Fortran and C... (no reason, ahem ðŸ‘€)
